How not to go against me, smart\nAnd it's absurd how people hang on every word\nI'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve\nBut I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved\nIf I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first\n'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse\nThat's why I'm clever when I put together every verse\nMy thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict\nI rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers\nBut I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles\nThe fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers\nSo this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em\nThe track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?\n'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters\nA plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so\n\n[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem]\n'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out\n'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth\n'Til the smoke clears out, am I high?
