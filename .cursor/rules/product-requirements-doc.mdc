# Product Requirements Document and Game Logic

- ALWAYS abide by the logic defined in [GameLogic.md](mdc:GameLogic.md). Do not write code that conflicts with the logic defined in [GameLogic.md](mdc:GameLogic.md).
- If I ever propose a change that conflicts with [GameLogic.md](mdc:GameLogic.md), let me know in your response so I know to modify the language myself.
- ALWAYS apply software engineering principles and best practices, including Single Responsibility Principle and separation of concerns. We need to ensure all of our code is modular.
