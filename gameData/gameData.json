Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture\n\nSo it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential \"Yo! MTV Raps\" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation\n\nWhile rap has evolved, there\u2019s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard\u2019s Hot Rap Songs chart, we\u2019re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally\u2019s quarter-century history.

What an amazing guy.\"\nWhen you hear he wrote a book your thoughts go to some of our greatest minds\nI said, \"What's your book about? Space and time?\nAncient tribes?\nThe economic crisis as we sit back and watch inflation rise\nNo, no, no, it's a novel, something more on the creative vibe\nNo, conspiracy theories\nChildren of The Matrix vibe\nDavid Icke\nPlease, tell me the subject you're takin' with this publication, cause I cannot take the hype\nHe looked me dead in the face, and right\nHe said, \"I wrote a book about complicated rhymes.\"\n\"Complicated rhymes?!\"\n\"Yeah. Multisyllabics\nThey absolutely have to be done when you rap to the punch of it like\nPlus the grammatical structure and pattern needs a straight function and fashion\nBut I'll allow for slight discrepancies depending on the native tongue of the accent but that does come with an asterisks\nAnd...you know...you know...who needs to kiss a girl?\nThat's stuff just a distraction, I don't need direct sunlight or a shower. None of it\nWhy would I go to a club and get plastered\nWhen I can stay at home, figure out the number of attractors\nAnd sift through my rejection emails to see if the publishers haven't told me I need to- told me I need to be fuckin' embarrassed?\"\nI'm joking\nHe's kissed a girl before\nHave you kissed a girl before?\nHe's kissed a girl before\nIn fact, Shuffle and his ex just finalized a fuckin' divorce\nBitch wrote the man a rhyme for Valentines and he told her her multi's were forced\nThe man even pointed a score\nGive her just under a four\nShe laughed it off\n\"Oh my Adam it's funny for sure.\"\nBut he said she should've known better she did something he just couldn't ignore\nEspecially now he's booked in the store so he doesn't love her no more\nFuckin' run for the door\nFuckin' guy\nAwkward as fuck, walkin' like he's got a wooden spine\nDoesn't let you sing \"Happy Birthday\" to him because it doesn't rhyme\nWore his weird fuckin' trench coat a 100 times\nGot you lookin' like you come disguised\nAs a cunt that likes the under 5's\nNonce!\nWore it so many times he doesn't need to hang up his coat\nHe hasn't washed it in years\nHe takes it off and it stands on it's own\nThat coat is alive\nIt's symbiosis\nIt demands the controls when attached to a host\nI saw him put his hand inside said jacket, and it actually moaned\n\"Oooh yeah.\"\n\"Oooh ye-\"\nEither it's been the same jacket for 10 years or you got ten on a rack on a special stack like Dexter's Lab\nEach of 'em have a tiny pocket which contains a microscopic list of all the sex you've had\nThat coat screams, \"Why does she never text me back?\"\nSo dirty every time he wears it his neck gets chapped and his flesh is cracked with a reddish rash\nI gave him a hook last week and my leg was scratched\nI had to get a \n\n[?]\nFuck that coat!\nI've never known anything to smell as bad, it gets me mad\nWhen I see it, it makes me wanna Jet like a Pepsi ad for collecting cans\nThat one's for the Netflix fans, you get me gang?\nBaow!\nThat's my first round in, safe star blessed\nI've got two more rounds and plenty more space in my graveyard left!\n\n[Round 1: Shuffle T]\nEverybody\u2019s been, telling me I won\u2019t ever survive my next foe\nI was never alive, been sentenced to life, they sent me to fry at death row\nThey\u2019ve already supplied some fresh clothes, the burial site, the headstone\nI\u2019m dead on arrival, end of the line, but ready to die, so let\u2019s go!\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve drafted a will\u2026\nNow I'd like Sounds Like to continue so I leave the registered rights to Pedro\nAnd I want Big J to finally get that sexy, designer trench coat\nAnd to Soul I leave my engraved piece of Jefferson Price\u2019s bedpost\nAnd a really, really, really long collection of rhymes for Death Note\nBecause I\u2019m battling Shotty Horroh \u2013 yeah?\nThe genius\nI mean it\nIn Manchester, this guy is Jesus\nI am in utter shock, I'm giddy \u2013 in pieces\nUnderprepared best man...I\u2019m speechless\nThey said, \"Shotty\u2019s back to battling, it\u2019s just like the olden days.\"\nCouldn\u2019t believe it \u201cGod\u2019s back, huh?

Let's talk foundations\nThere's a difference between rock bottom and ground breakers\nIf I would've showed up today without patience, you'd be an outpatient\nAhh\nMortician, Shuffle on the table without Vegas\nI am thee, without a doubt greatest\nOut of town blazin', an ounce \n\n[?]\nYou're just me, without flavor\nDowngraded, outdated\nShotty, Tony, Soul, Kruger, Bizzo, Bobby, Unan', you're about 8ish\nWait, that's without Arkaic, I can't downplay him\nFuck Shuffle T!\nI've been talkin' smokin', Loud statements\nDJ with the drop on him, Shuffle on the floor like house ravers\nYou rhyme words together really well\nThat's why the people love you, but that's just one piece of the secret puzzle\nThat's like missin' the sea cause you see the puddle\nThat's where you seem to struggle\nYou perform like your knees were buckled if you even push up a feeble muscle\nYOU let him do this with no conviction\nJust like if someone looks like him finds himself in legal trouble\nHe stays insecure, stood on the spot lookin' like he needs a cuddle as he speaks so discrete and subtle\nThat's why we don't believe in ya\nSo many elite MC's that leagues above ya\nWe don't in Shuffle like the deal's a hustle\nYou get it, but that ain't the gamblin' part\nI told Briggzy we're gonna need a proper Shuffle or it's gonna damage the card\nYou think pretending to not have an ego is the cheat code\nLike it's an invincible spell\nHe thinks that if any MC is givin' him hell he just needs to giggle as well and it isn't an L\nAll that nonchalant shit of you bein' the biggest you could be\nIf you don't believe it, we don't believe it as well\nI mean all that self deprecating only made you be little (belittle) yourself\nSecond round in, safe star bless\nOnly one more round and plenty more space in that graveyard left\n\n[Round 2: Shuffle T]\n\n{Shuffle pulls out his phone}\n\n\"Hey, yeah, um, can I speak to someone in HR?\nYeah it's to deal with well-being and safeguards\n2-9-1-5 is the number on my name card\nMy place of work is Shotty Horroh\u2019s Graveyard\nMy complaints are - I never get told when a new shipment of bodies is coming in...which is a great start\nI just have to wait for them to magically pop up on my radar\nAnd I think he\u2019s in denial cause, I know where the graves are\nAnd he always saying that he isn't, but he is running out of space fast\nIf we ask too many questions he forces us out\nHe turns up some days and orders us 'round\nHe was meant to be in for a meeting at a quarter to...now\nSome are saying he won\u2019t show up\nThat\u2019s what people are saying\nIt's a hassle, it's a stress, it's havoc, it's a mess\nI just get batches of the dead turn up through National Express\nAnd if I ask how they died that\u2019s a sackable offence\nAm I to believe that he...What? Rap battles them to death?\nI\u2019m calling today cause I\u2019ve just had someone through, Tali\nAnother hopeless victim\nAnd I\u2019m looking around and I\u2019ve got no idea for the life of me where I\u2019m s\u2019posed to fit him\nPlot 3?\nNo that\u2019s taken. It\u2019s taken it don\u2019t need filling\nWell, I can put Tali in there but he\u2019s going to have Tony with him\nI get that these things are best handled with stealth\nIt\u2019s just - it\u2019s extra stress for me, which is bad for my health\nBut I guess I\u2019ve just got to deal with the hand I was dealt\nWhat was your name? Alright, Briggzy, well thanks for your help.\"\nListen, I'm glad he's laughin', cause usually he's terrifying\nWhen he does smile, his Face ID doesn\u2019t recognize him\nThat, and you've put on a \n\n[?] amount of weight\nA bit of padding around the face\nYou're the man of the house, it's great\nI bet your calorie count's insane\nBut I'm not intimidated by you, that wasn't how I was raised\nI don't feel fear next to you, I just feel massively out of shape\nNow, he DID beat me in that film VS \u2013 but it was hard for me to lose that\nCause I first wrote my side of the battle they said, \u201cWe can\u2019t really use that\nIt needs to be WORSE than Shotty\u2019s material, so can you write us a new rap?\u201d\nI said, \u201cWORSE than Shotty\u2019s stuff\u2026? I don\u2019t know if I can do that.\u201d\nIn the end I had to go through about 100,000 scripts\nTo make my stuff as bad as what\u2019s coming out that fucking mouth of his\nAt one point I just screwed up a piece of paper and rubbed it 'round in shit\nThe director said, \u201cI think we\u2019ll need to dumb it down a bit.\u201d\nI was in 8 Mile as well, you seen it? Ahh, it's genius as fuck\nProducer called me personally said, \u201cWe need you for this, Shuff\u201d\nI was meant to lose to Eminem, but the scenes have all been cut\nApparently, me getting beat wasn\u2019t \u201cbelievable enough\u201d\nNow listen, me and funny go together like bees and honey\nEasy money, Heretic and a vegan curry\nBut it\u2019s an understatement if you're describing me as \u2018hungry\u2019\nThat\u2019s like calling Ian Huntley a \u2018cheeky monkey\u2019\nI feel so comfy up here, I\u2019m winning this in every round\nI should be getting out my armchair, slippers and a dressing gown\nYou should bring Briggzy in as well, man! Fuck it, just for a laugh\nWe can turn this in to a 1v1 and a half\nCause look at all the people that you have to bring with you\nThe second that a battle\u2019s not inside of the M62\nI could\u2019ve had this battle in your house in your parent\u2019s living room\nAnd have them both arguing over who they\u2019d give it to\nYour mom gives it to me\nSo, if I were you, I would honestly hide in a safe space\nBecause this could cost you your life and that is fucking mate\u2019s rates\nI am in here to have a couple of quick beers and slay\nI don\u2019t care if the Sharks or the Knights are the ones that win here today\nDon\u2019t get that misconstrued, I mean MY win\u2019s clear on stage\nI just don\u2019t care about the teams, cause I\u2019m not 6 years of age\nEvery performance I have out of 10 I give myself a million\nI am my own worst critic and I think I\u2019m fucking brilliant!\nSo fuck it, the round's done, I got his back to the turnbuckle\nLet\u2019s all see how many puns this cunt has for the word \u2018shuffle\u2019\nTime\n\n[Round 3: Shotty Horroh]\nI mean Shuffle T's funny as fuck\nI've been quotin' him when he's roastin' them\nAs far as the stand up comedy rap battle fans go, it's either O'shea or him to be the GOAT for them\nBut there's this Joe Pesci notion...\nFunny how? If you focusin'\nCause there's two types of funny in this world bro and you're both of 'em\nCause you're funny, like you're funny when they're lovin' your clowin'\nBut you're funny like there's really somethin' funny about him\nCause I don't fuck my friends over\nYou get bad luck from it\nPussy try bein' a stand up guy before you try bein' a stand up comic\nCause no matter what Cruger and Bags do for this lad, you know he's team Rowan forever\nHe literally robbed your friends of their business pursuit as he DM'd you, you instantly fold to the pressure\nHe's payin' you with the money that he owes to them...don't act like you didn't know any better\nCrazy that you made a paperback when you was the staple that didn't have the spine to hold it together\nHe does not give a fuck\nI've never met anybody as bold as he is\nCan you imagine him, Cruger and Bagnall on Zoom if they host a meetin' for the Sound Like show that evenin'?\nAnd he's tangent off to Don't Flop, the whole case, the whole proceedings\nHe sat there like, \"What a cunt. What a cunt. Sorry guys that's my phone. Hello Roooooo- Hello Ronan Keating\nBoys I have Ronan Keating.\"\nHe does not give a fuck, you have to understand\nThat shit he did with Liam and Freddie, that shit made 'em sick, they ain't just anybodys\nWithout them, I don't think the scene you see today exists\nI'm not saying you're a piece of shit cause you didn't hold it down\nI'm just sayin', you ain't legit\nCause he tried doin' the same shit to my brother, and we squaded up and created this\nLoyal to the soil\nI don't fuck with anybody that wants to play with Briggz\nYou don't like him, I don't you, simple, plain as shit\nThat's why our careers meet at a fork in the road, and they separate, like this\nCause you're still maintainin' a main event career and gettin' a wage from it\nAnd I'm the guy that pays you it\nAnd I did your little panel show for free twice\nIt was COVID times I let the love persuade me\nYou couldn't sell tickets, make money, there was no crowd, stuff was crazy\nYou came at me with the whole \"we're friends\" angle and I \n\n[?]\nCause me charging Shuffle shady\nUntil we needed you during the pandemic and your attitude was \"fuck you pay me\"\nSo fuck Shuffle T and his book and his infiltrating, gentrification in a class\nThese posh cunts can't see what the streets created with the scraps\nAnd wanna turn it into data and a \n\n[?]\n\"Click this link and learn how to be hip hop\"\nFUCK OFF!\nWe ain't got the patience for all a dat\nFor your book to be useful to me, I'd have to tape it to my abs so I was safe from gettin' stabbed\nI didn't learn this shift from a fuckin' book\nI was battlin' on the street corner since I had a bus pass and pocket full of dust caps\nPeople hated, FUCK THAT\nI handled the positive and the negative like a blood bank\nMe versus you, 1 on 1 ain't a good match\nCause I've always been a couple points above you like a umlaut\nNext thing I wanna talk about is very fuckin' serious\nIt's not a joke\nCause I don't trust a man who's arms don't move when he walks\nIt's one of those\nWhy do your arms look so heavy bro?\nI gotta know\nYou look like every single \n\n[?] trying to carry your mum's worth of shopping home\nFuckin' strange guy\nLookin' like the little Men In Black alien inside him can't operate the arms and the legs at the same time\nAnd thank you very much\nAnother straight, white, male with a podcast\nWith long hair and edgy jokes\nIt's fuckin' Russel off-Brand\n\nThat's me, thank you\n\n[Round 3: Shuffle T]\nNow your music has actually been a little different lately\nWhen you up and switch so fucking quick it comes across as shady\nThat Scum Of The Earth album was so Oasis influenced it was crazy\nI said, \u201cDo you think you might have ripped them off a bit?\u201d He said \u201cmayyyyyybeeeeeeee!\"\nI said, \u201cYeah, Definitely Maybe\nHere\u2019s what I think happened, I think you started copying them 'Little By Little'\nThen you just 'Roll With It'\nHead up in the clouds\nI mean he doesn\u2019t hear it\nIt makes him wonder what all ('Wonderwall') the fuss is about\nNo one\u2019s more pissed off than me, I liked how your old albums sound\nIn fact, I don\u2019t believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now\n'Don't Look Back In Anger'\nYou blended Brit pop and hip hop with rock\nThought it would be shit hot, big shock, it\u2019s not\nYou ripped off a band you like, and yeah you did it beautifully\nBut musically, now you\u2019re nowhere near as good as it used to be\nCause when you sell out your art for a dime\nIt\u2019ll never be far from your mind\nCause when you\u2019ve been cast to the side those steps are a bastard to climb\nYou\u2019re energy starved and you\u2019ll try, but never regrasp on those heights\nYour penmanship starts to decline, your presence your bars and your lines\nAnd everything\u2019s harder to rhyme\nIntegrity\u2019s hard to define\nBut when you pretend to be part of a life\nOf the celebrity\u2019s art that you like\nAll you\u2019re doing is karaoke, you dress up you dance and you mime\nSo, all you\u2019ve actually done is perfected the art of disguise\nThat\u2019s why you\u2019re running out of smoke like a contestant on Stars In Their Eyes\nTonight Matthew, I\u2019m going to shove Noel\u2019s Gallagher\u2019s dick in every hole that it can fit\nThe only role that you can give, this ain\u2019t a cold slap on the wrist\nYou\u2019re facing the whole character list of Soul Caliber 6\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s saying shit lines these days like\n\"It Tali and (Italian) blood run in the streets\", oh my God, you're such a prick\nThe Manny crowd were loving it, most people wouldn\u2019t fuck with it\nI was just watching with a confused face, I couldn\u2019t keep up with it\nNot because it's too complex, just cause it's fucking shit\n\"Italian blood running the streets\" \u2013 I\u2019ll slow down I\u2019m out maneuvering\nI'm gettin' a bit too complex so let me do some tutoring\nSee I said something about the mafia, but I included in his pseudonym\nI don\u2019t give a shit if you crammed his name in there it still has fuck all to do with him\nLet me say something simple and make it official\nBattle rap bars aren't personal cause their name or initial was placed in the middle\nEvery round from you these days is just this crazy horrid scheme\nYou make it sound complex but it\u2019s always just the same obnoxious theme\nPeople used to be able to battle in a way they\u2019d want to speak\nWhatever happened to just fucking saying what you mean?\nEvery line it\u2019s \u201cI said one thing that sounds like another thing. Isn't that clever?\u201d\nI\u2019m just watching from the side like \u201cMate. It isn\u2019t that clever.\u201d\nSo, I won\u2019t dress this up with word play I\u2019ll just tell you what the truth is\nI think insecurity is the reason you became a unit\nYour battles aren\u2019t that great these days, neither is your music\nI think you\u2019re overrated, and I think you\u2019re fuckin' stupid\nThis is loud-mouth bullshit versus strong and silent\nYou make something simple feel like rocket science\nI make rocket science feel like comic timing\nLike Hugh Laurie, The Two Ronnies or Monty Python\nIt doesn\u2019t make an ounce of difference how you spin it\nWhich way round you flip it, upside down and twisted\nI am bound to win this, and the crowd can witness\nThis counterfeited coward\u2019s limits\nThere\u2019s always praise for you and you\u2019re showered with it\nPut on a pedestal like some proud exhibit\nThey put you in the top 4 they\u2019ve mapped out your image\nWell, you can have Mount Rushmore I\u2019ll take Mount Olympus\nYou say I\u2019m a clown as if it means that I\u2019m annoyed\nI love that reputation, that's my pride and joy\nSo, go find some 'roids, alright? Enjoy!\nTake that belt to its biting point\nI\u2019ll just kick you in the bollocks with my clown shoes so hard you\u2019ll have a higher voice than a choirboy\u2019s!\nIf you\u2019re watching from overseas \u2013 watch more UK battle rap\nWatch Frankie, Frost, Oshea, Cojay, Gemini, It\u2019s action packed\nWatch Premier Battles, Don't Flop, No Loose Chat, fuck it - watch some Danny Jaqq\nJust stop giving all your attention to this overrated fuckin' twat!\nSee, I beat you with word play, angles, aggression, concepts, this battle\u2019s what I make it\nYou just forever rely on Americanized generically rhymed name flips\nYou\u2019re an imitator \u2013 you see what\u2019s out there and you claim it\nI\u2019m an innovator \u2013 I see what\u2019s out there and I change it",

Perhaps\nI'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse\n'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out ('Til the roof, until the roof)\n'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth (The roof comes off, the roof comes off)\n'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps ('Til my legs, until my legs)\nI'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse (Give out from underneath me)\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nMusic is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get\nWhen you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit\nThis is your moment, and every single minute you spend\nTryna hold on to it, 'cause you may never get it again\nSo while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can\nAnd when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end\n'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in\nI got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in\nIt goes: Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie\nAndr\u00e9 from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me\nBut in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy\nSo when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me\nThat's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me\nEven though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me\nYou hate it, but you know respect you got to give me\nThe press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney \u2014 Nate, hit me!\n\n[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem]\n'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out\n'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth\n'Til the smoke clears out, am I high?

Perhaps ('Til my legs, until my legs)\nI'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse (Give out from underneath me)\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nSoon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart\nWhat is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart\nAnd it's absurd how people hang on every word\nI'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve\nBut I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved\nIf I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first\n'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse\nThat's why I'm clever when I put together every verse\nMy thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict\nI rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers\nBut I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles\nThe fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers\nSo this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em\nThe track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?\n'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters\nA plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so\n\n[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem]\n'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out\n'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth\n'Til the smoke clears out, am I high?
