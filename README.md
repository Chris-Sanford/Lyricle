# Lyricle (description based on MVP)

Lyricle is a web-based Lyric guessing game. Play the daily challenge for your favorite genre or choose one of your favorite songs and put your knowledge to the test!

# Run Lyricle Locally

Lyricle is fully HTML and JavaScript, and therefore doesn't require any special software and doesn't need to be compiled. Install the web server of your choice (Live Server extension for VSCode perhaps?), launch in a web browser, and play!

# Host Lyricle

With Lyricle being lightweight, complex server architecture is not necessary. Any modern cloud platform that supports serverless architecture for HTML/JS web applications will work!
